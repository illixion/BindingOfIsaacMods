    <description>This mod allows you to toggle automatic usage of your active item by holding the space bar or use button on a controller. Once auto use is enabled, the item will automatically be used as soon as it's fully charged. No longer will you have to remember to keep using Guppy's Head, Book of Sin or any other item, especially with 4.5 Volt.
